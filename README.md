# Get started

The idea is explained in detail in the paper, therefore the focus below will be on how to install everything to easily reproduce experiments (or perform new ones). Requirements and details for each part are outlined in the README files in the corresponding directory.


## Setting the environment
1. Clone the repository.
2. Read the README.md file in the rtabmap directory and install it.
3. Read the README.md file in the rtabmap_ros directory and install it. For our experiments, ROS Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04 were used, as the Campus rosbags were captured with the same configurations.
4. Read the README.md file in the RegionLearner directory.
